What is this?
---------
A game made by 2(~3) people in the context of Mini Jam #5 arranged by http://www.ungespiludviklere.dk/
The Task is to make a game in 48 hours with a specific theme, with other people who is interested in Game- Designing & Development.

<b>The theme for this Jam was: <i>Auto-Generated</i></b>

Game, Controls & Setup
---------
<b><i>You're 2-4 knights who fought to the core of a vulcano. Now the time is running up and the vulcano is collapsing with platforms moving about. Quickly kill the other knigths & survive the magma!<i></b>

When players enter the level - Then the platforms will start to shift and new "islands" will appear.
The players shall in this time try to avoid the collapsing (Jittering!) islands, and jump onto new ones.
Al though, while still being able to kill & block the other players.
The last to survive the level wins, and the round restarts.

Controls are the following:
<ul>
	<li>Left Analog Stick - Movement</li>
	<li>Button A - Attacking</li>
	<li>Button B - Blocking</li>
	<li>Button X - Jumping</li>
</ul>
The Controls have been made in mind of playing from 2-4 players, each with their own Microsoft Xbox Controller attached to the Computer running the Game.

When first entering the game you will be greeted by a Screen saying "Get Ready, Knights!".
The players who want to join press A to toggle their Player on the screen - Here they can also see which colour they are.
When ready, then player 1 presses "Start" button on his/her controller to start the game. And the round begins.

Happy fighting, Knights!
