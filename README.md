What is this?
---------
A game made by 2(~3) people in the context of Mini Jam #5 arranged by http://www.ungespiludviklere.dk/
The Task is to make a game in less than 48 hours with an optional theme, with other people who is interested in Game Design & Development.

<b>The theme for this Jam was: <i>Auto-Generated</i></b>

Game, Controls & Setup
---------
<b><i>You're knights who fight at the bottom of a vulcano. Now the time is running out and the vulcano is collapsing and the platforms moving around. Quickly kill your opponents while avoiding the magma!<i></b>

When players enter the level - Then the platforms will start to shift and new "islands" will appear.
The players shall in this time try to avoid the collapsing (Jittering!) islands, and jump onto new ones.
Al though, while still being able to kill & block the other players.
The last to survive the level wins, and the round restarts.

Controls are the following:
<ul>
  <li>Left Analog Stick - Movement</li>
  <li>Button A - Attacking / Join Game</li>
  <li>Button B - Blocking</li>
  <li>Button X - Jumping</li>
  <li>Start - Start Game</li>
</ul>
The Controls have been made in mind of playing from 2-4 players, each with their own Microsoft Xbox Controller attached to the Computer running the Game.

When first entering the game you will be greeted by a Screen saying "Get Ready, Knights!".
The players who want to join press A to toggle their Player on the screen - Here they can also see which colour they are.
When ready, then any player press "Start" button on his/her controller to start the game. And the game begins.

Happy fighting, Knights!
